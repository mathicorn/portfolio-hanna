## Hunch  <a name = "hunch"></a>
I would like to build an app for musicians since there are very few targeted at just the music community in an interactive way. I hope to use this app to provide various forms of support to provide motivation through their musical journeys. 

## Interviewees <a name = "interviewees"></a>
I plan to interview a high schooler and a middle schooler. The high schooler, AC, taught himself how to play piano, but has never taken lessons. Through interviewing him, I want to understand the rationale behind why he doesn't take lessons and the obstacles that he may face on that front. The middle schooler, RH, briefly learned music but no longer plays an instrument. I want to figure out why he quit, and, through discovering his other interests, explore ways to potentially increase interest and motivation to learn music. These people are both different from me--music is my biggest passion, and I took a lot of lessons throughout primary and secondary school. They also cover two main types of issues that I may want to address--lack of interest in playing instruments, and not being able to/willing to take lessons. I hope that through interviewing them I may come up with solutions to some of these problems.

<details>
<summary><b>RH Interview</b></summary>

- **Hi RH, would you be available for an interview over the phone? I have some questions related to your hobbies and music, it's for a school project that I'm doing.:** Yes, I'm available now. How long will it take?
- **It will be about 15 minutes, I expect. Is that alright with you?:** Yes I have plenty of time today.
- **Great! Before we start, are you okay if I write down your answers and publish them? You will be anonymized (I will only use your initials).:** Yes.
- **Describe your experience with playing instrumental music:** I tried learning piano and violin before but quit both after a few months
- **Why did you decide to quit?:** I realized I didn't enjoy the activities and I wanted to explore my other interests instead.
- **What about your musical activities did you not enjoy (especially the aspects that made you quit)?:** I found practicing boring and repetitive. I couldn't see any clear targets and I could not feel the gratification of solving problems.
- **That makes sense, repetition can definitely be boring. Did you enjoy any part of your musical journey though? If so, which one(s)?:** It was fun when I could finally play a piece coherently. I like listening to the final product, it's just the process wasn't fun for me.
- **I see. What were the biggest challenges you faced during your journey?:** I would definitely say a lack of detailed purposes. I didn't know what I was doing until I got to where I wanted to be, which sometimes took a long time.
- **Did you do anything to overcome these challenges?:** I asked my teacher about it, but both times they said to just keep practicing and I will reach the goal, which did not help for me. 
- **I see. So if you could have a do-over, what would you change?:** I wish I could have been able to set better goals, but I'm not sure what I could change to achieve that. 
- **So, going on a tangent here, tell me about your other hobbies, especially the ones that you spend the most time on.:** I mostly like developing and playing video games.
- **Ooh that sounds really fun, tell me more!:** Well, for developing, I code in Unity and repeatedly test my code by playing through what I have. In terms of playing games, I like playing Geometry Dash.
- **Coding a game seems really hard! I'm sure you face challenges at some points--what about these challenges makes u enjoy the process?:** I can see the progress more clearly, whereas for practicing music it seems like an endless loop often. 
- **That can definitely be frustrating, I get you there. So, to make sure I understood you correctly, you like that you can feel rewarded during the process as well? Is it by seeing the light at the end of the tunnel, or something else?:** I think it's mostly that I can see clear goals, both the end product and the middle product, whereas for music I can't. 
- **I'm glad you have those goals for your game developing and playing. What are the exact goals?:** For example, for game dev, if my final goal is to make a certain game, my individual goals would be perfecting a certain level or part of the scenery. For playing video games, it was based on beating the different rooms or sections of each level of the game. 
- **Those are definitely much clearer goals. How did you overcome the challenges you faced while pursuing these hobbies (game dev or playing video games) though?:** I could write tests for my games, and I could break things down or watch videos online for when I was trying to play video games.
- **That makes sense. So, if you were provided with smaller goals in music, do you think you would maybe enjoy practicing more?:** I think I definitely would. I actually kept trying to find these goals but always failed to. Somehow my efforts with game dev didn't work on music.
- **Setting goals can definitely be hard, especially smaller or intangible goals. Hopefully you can find a way to set these goals.:** I really hope so too.
- **That was all that I wanted to ask for this interview, thank you for your time.**

<summary><b>AC Interview</b></summary>

- **Hi AC, would you be available for an interview over the phone? I have some questions related to your hobbies and music, it's for a school project that I'm doing.:** Sounds fun, I can do it now if you want.
- **Are you okay if I write down these and publish them? You will be anonymized (I will only use your initials).:** Yes.
- **Great. Last thing, this will be about 10 to 15 minutes.:** Sounds good!
- **Describe your experience with playing instrumental music:** I taught myself how to play piano in elementary school and I play on my electrical keyboard whenever I can. Sometimes I can play up to 3 hours a day.
- **That's really cool! 3 hours is a long time. Why did you decide to teach yourself how to play piano?:** I like learning things by myself, I find it much more enjoyable.
- **I get that. So I heard you have never taken lessons. Do you have a reason for this?:** I don't enjoy the format of taking lessons, where I have to sit down and focus for long periods of time. I prefer learning by myself, since the process of exploration is rewarding.
- **It definitely can be! When you learned by yourself, did you use any resources?:** I didn't really except, of course, various sheet music I found online. Maybe some short videos as well.
- **Those are definitely good resources. Which would you say was most helpful and how/why?:** The videos were definitely the most helpful, such as for learning certain techniques and how to read music. 
- **Yep, interactive mediums such as videos seem useful. What would you say were the biggest challenges during your process?:** I think the main problem was that the videos were hard to find, since they were all over the place and not organized into anything useful. 
- **That can be hard for sure! But it's good that you still managed to become so advanced at piano. What would you say was the most fun part of your journey?:** I think it was all really fun! But if I had to pick one, I would have to say the day I could finally play the first Chopin Nocturne. I felt so happy that I could finally play one of my favorite pieces at the time. 
- **That does sound rewarding, I'm glad you were able to enjoy that moment. What are your goals as a musician/pianist moving forward?:** I want to learn some other pieces I really like, such as the Beethoven Waldstein Sonata and maybe even a piano concerto. 
- **Good luck with those goals! If you could change something about your journey, what would this change be?:** I would figure out ways to take lessons or learn more systematically because I can definitely see the technical flaws in my playing but it's hard to fix them now. 
- **I hope you can overcome those challenges. To wrap this up, if you had a set of organized tutorial videos, how much would that have helped you?:** It would definitely have been more helpful. 
- **Thank you for taking the time to participate in this interview.**

## Summaries <a name = "summaries"></a>

<details>
<summary><b>RH</b></summary>
This interviewee did not have much passion for music so far, which was expected since I knew before that he "quit both [piano and violin] after a few months". However, it was surprising that he seemed disappointed that he disliked practicing. He even "asked [his] teacher about it", but received ideas that were not helpful. I managed to find out that he does not enjoy tasks where there is only one far away visible goal and nothing tangible or close. He also seemed to have trouble with setting these goals with music. This differed from how he could set goals for other activities such as game dev or playing games. This made sense to me, since setting goals can be hard for some intangible things where you cannot immediately see results, while on the other hand he could set goals like "perfecting a certain level" of a game he was developing or "beating the different rooms" in the game he was playing. I was once again surprised at the end when he said that if he were able to form goals better he would enjoy practicing more, and how if he were to change one thing it would be "to set better goals"; however this did make sense, since he seemed to simply be frustrated about not seeing progress, instead of finding the music itself boring.

<summary><b>AC</b></summary>
This interviewee has always been very passionate about music. I was surprised by his reason for not taking lessons--I thought it had to do with his financial situation, but it turns out he doesn't "enjoy the format of taking lessons", and prefers "learning by [him]self". However, contradictory to his claim that he likes learning by himself, he says that he watched tutorial videos online. Not only that, but he said that "the videos were definitely the most helpful". This led me to believe that it's not that he doesn't like learning from others, it's that he finds long sit-down lessons boring. The reason he still faced obstacles was because "the videos were hard to find...and not organized", so I think that if there was a more systematic way for him to learn piano through short videos or interactive platforms, he would maybe enjoy that more and face less challenges. He seemed really excited when talking about his journey and when he accomplished his goals, which was in line with what I expected from him. Overall, I felt like, although he faced obstacles and has objections to taking lessons, he has a very strong passion for music, and an app could fix the problems he was facing.

## Designs <a name = "designs"></a>

- One option is to create an app in which music learning can be organized in the form of short tutorial videos. The users would practice and perfect the tutorials, and receive points towards traveling on and completing certain game maps when done with each video level. For this idea, AC would be able to have an organized system of videos that he could watch, which would not be too long for his attention span; RH would also be able to use completing the tutorials and traveling on the game maps as more concrete goals for his practice. While the former part (tutorial videos) may already exist in some apps, the game maps part will serve as extra motivation for users, which is useful. 
- Another option is to have an interactive system where the users can be connected with professional musicians, where they then receive specific instructions (i.e. practice a certain thing). They then record videos and send them to the musicians to receive feedback. This would be good for AC because he would be able to mostly do things on his own, but at the same time receive some sort of guidance; for RH, this would provide more clear goals as well. Of course, the professional musicians would need to be provided with guidelines as well on how to provide more detailed instructions to the users. 
- Yet another option is to make a practice tracking app that enables users to enter their current desired repertoire (new pieces to learn), and helps these users break down the songs into smaller pieces (for example, different sections or slower tempos). This app will also provide recordings that can be split into sections, slowed down, or sped up. This app would also have a tree or timeline of suggestions for pieces to practice, in order. The recordings aspect and timeline aspect will provide structure in the form of videos, which were most helpful for people like AC; this also provides goals for people like RH, since they would be able to check off the pieces or sections that they have completed.
